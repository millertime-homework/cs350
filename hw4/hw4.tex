MOST-RELIABLE-PATH(G, source)
1  mark each vertex as distance infinity
2  mark each vertex's previous vertex as undefined
3  mark the source's distance as 0
4  put all of the vertices in a Queue
5  while the Queue is not empty
6    find the vertex u with the least distance
7    if that vertex is the target
8      create a new sequence S
9      while previous vertex of u is defined
10       add u at the beginning of S
11       continue to u's previous vertex
12     remove that vertex from the Queue
13   for each neighbor v of that vertex
14     add the negative logs of u and (u,v)
15     if the sum is less than the current value of v's distance
16       set v's distance to that sum
17       set v's previous vertex to u
